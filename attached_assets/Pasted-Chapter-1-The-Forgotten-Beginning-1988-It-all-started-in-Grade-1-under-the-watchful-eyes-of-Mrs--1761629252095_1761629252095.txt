Chapter 1: The Forgotten Beginning (1988) It all started in Grade 1, under the watchful eyes of Mrs. Sumulong. He remembers me clearly — the girl who refused to sit beside him because of his chicken pox. I, on the other hand, have no memory of that moment. But somehow, even then, I had already left a mark on him.

Chapter 2: Friendship in Bloom (1994) Fate brought us back together in high school. Same section, same room — but this time, we sat side by side. That’s when our friendship blossomed. We became inseparable best friends, sharing laughter, secrets, and teenage adventures. We strolled through malls, hung out after school, and leaned on each other through heartbreaks. Though we had our own love lives, ours was a bond that quietly deepened with time.

Chapter 3: Sparks in the Silence (1998) College gave us a new chance. We reconnected — late-night phone calls, movie dates, and long walks in the mall. It was subtle at first, like a whisper in the wind. But somewhere between the laughter and the silences, love tiptoed in. That’s when our story truly began.

Chapter 4: Against All Odds (1999) I was supposed to transfer to Zambales for school, but love makes teenagers reckless. We were young, passionate, and defiant. I stayed in Manila, choosing love over plans. But life had its own twists. We made choices that changed everything. I got pregnant. We married in haste, civilly, and suddenly we were no longer just lovers — we were partners in a storm.

Chapter 5: Through the Fire The road was rocky. There were tears, fights, and moments when it felt like we were falling apart. But somehow, through grace and grit, we found our way back to each other. We held on — not just for our children, but for the love that had weathered every storm.

Chapter 6: Still Us Today, we’re still here. Still choosing each other. Still giving our best shot — not just as parents, but as two souls who met as children and grew into love. Ours is not a perfect story, but it’s real. It’s raw. And it’s ours.
